Before you want to edit

put (Example)
// Zi Qi editing
into the first line in Main Code.cpp
then copy ALL of the codes into your DEV C++ to start your work

remove it after finish editing
so that there will be no overlapping at the same time


After you FINISH or want to STOP editing, paste ALL of the codes (including the updated part) back into the Main Code.cpp file

THEN, go in to Edit History and create a new file
12-12-1212 - 13:45 - Zi Qi.cpp
   Date       Time    Name.cpp
   
   
After file was created, paste the same FULL newest code into the file and click 'Commit New File'.
This must be done everytime to prevent OVERWRITE.
